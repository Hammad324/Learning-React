# React + Vite
npm create vite@latest

With vite we only get react and react-dom no other packages, just the bare mininmum. All component function's names should have their first letters capitalized and their files should have a **.jsx** extension. Injects the script similarly as in js as main.jsx.

- less files, lightweight
- standardized file and component names  
- only a single element can be sent in a component.
- therefore create an outer div and then send it OR
- we will render what is known as a fragment. <></> (syntax)

# React
npx create react-app (name-of-app)

When we create a react project using create react-app we get all the packages installed such as testing packages and others as well. We can name the component files with **.js** extension but the component function's name should be capitalized. Injects react script automatically since it downloads them when we reun the command for creating the app.
